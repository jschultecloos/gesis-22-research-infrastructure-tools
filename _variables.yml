abstract: | 
  Literate programming, version control, and containers enable us to create reproducible workflows, track code, and build stable research infrastructure. 
  The benefits are greater efficiency, ease of tracing our research progress, and smoother collaboration with other researchers. 
  This course provides participants with the skills to harness the potential of these tools.  
  It equips them with a toolkit to track and disseminate their code, data, and analyses, both when working on independent projects and in collaborations with others.
